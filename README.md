Peniquitous
===========

A Google Chrome browser extension that provides Ctrl-P & Ctrl-N support for
search field drop-down lists.

When search fields offer a list of suggestions, they often support using the up
& down keys to choose a suggestion. This extension works by simulating the up &
down arrow keys when you press Ctrl-P & Ctrl-N.

Using these new key combinations, you can save a couple seconds moving your
hand to the arrow keys or take advantage of the muscle memory instilled from
GNU Readline, Emacs, and other console applications.
